# oci

Attempt at making a package that pulls container images and makes them become OCI compatible, while using as little dependencies as possible, aside for stuff I specifically want in a client package (like tracing).

Other packages exist that already do this, but they import a ton of dependencies, sometimes vendored ðŸ˜“, force me to buy into a ton of things I don't want to buy into, and do all kind of things that I don't need or want them to do.
